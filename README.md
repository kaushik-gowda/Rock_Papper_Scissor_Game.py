Rock, Paper, Scissors - Python Game ðŸŽ®
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer, which randomly selects its move.

How It Works-
	The user is prompted to enter Rock, Paper, or Scissors (case-insensitive).
 	The computer makes a random choice from the three options.
	The program determines the winner based on standard game rules:
	Rock beats Scissors
	Scissors beat Paper
	Paper beats Rock
	The game continues until the user types Q to quit.
At the end, the program displays the total wins for both the user and the computer.
